# 🧼 PacketGhost Data Broker Removal Rankings

> Built for transparency. Just the truth on who actually removes your personal data from the internet — with proof.

## 🔍 What Is This?

This project ranks and scores personal data broker removal services using a weighted, ethics-focused system. It's designed to help privacy-conscious users find **tools that actually work**, not tools with the best marketing.

No sponsored rankings. No shady money. Just real research.

## 🧠 Why I Made This

After observing this space closely — especially through forums, subreddits, and sponsored content — I noticed most services rely on hype, vague claims, or influencer deals rather than transparency and results.

So I created a ranking system that rewards:
- Real transparency
- Verifiable results
- Ethical marketing practices

And while I don’t take affiliate deals from most companies, I do support **one exception**:

👉 **[Optery](https://get.optery.com/ev1xqres14zd)** — the only service I’ve found that:
- Offers **screenshot-based proof**
- Covers over 300+ brokers
- Doesn’t own biased review websites
- Is priced fairly and has a usable free plan (even cheaper with code "packetghost" for 20% off)

It’s not the focus of this project, but it’s a tool I trust — so I support it.

## 📊 Why Are the Rankings Weighted?

Not all features matter equally.

Some features directly improve your privacy — like proof of removal or verified data scanning. Others, like refund policies or a nice UI, are helpful but secondary. That’s why this system uses **weighted scoring**, not a flat checklist.

### 🔑 Here's the thinking:

| Feature                        | Weight | Why It Matters Most |
|-------------------------------|--------|----------------------|
| ✅ **Proof-Based Removals**   | 2x     | Without screenshots or receipts, you’re just trusting them blindly. |
| ✅ **Massive Broker Coverage**| 3x     | The more sites a service covers, the more exposure it eliminates. |
| ✅ **Verified Data Discovery**| 2x     | Only removing what’s actually there is smarter and more respectful of users. |
| ❌ **Owning Review Sites**    | -3x    | If you rank yourself, you're not a review — you're a funnel. |

Other features like refund policies, family plans, and free tiers are included, but weighted less.

## 🤝 Affiliate Disclosure & Integrity Policy

We only use **one affiliate link**, and that’s for **[Optery](https://get.optery.com/ev1xqres14zd)** — the only service we've tested that provides real, screenshot-based proof of data removal, covers hundreds of brokers, and avoids manipulative marketing.

### Why not others?

- ❌ **DeleteMe**: Heavy on influencer promotions and advertising, light on proof or transparency.
- ❌ **Incogni**: Tied to companies that own review websites — creating a major conflict of interest.
- ❌ **Other services**: Either too expensive, too vague, or offer no measurable transparency.

No one can pay to improve their ranking here. Period.
