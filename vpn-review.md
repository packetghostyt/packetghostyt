## Affiliate Program Policy

We maintain **strict ethical standards** for affiliate relationships. Affiliate links are only used for VPNs that meet the following **non-negotiable criteria**:

1. **No Ownership or Investment in Review Sites**  
   The VPN provider must **not own**, fund, or hold any stake in any VPN review website or media outlet that evaluates VPNs.

2. **No Influence on Reviews**  
   The VPN provider must **not pressure**, manipulate, or restrict how we review or rank them.

Any partnership must align with our values of **independence and transparency**. If a VPN fails to meet these standards, we will not engage in an affiliate relationshipâ€”regardless of compensation.

PacketGhost started with zero affiliate links because we wanted to prove something: honest, data-driven VPN reviews can exist without selling out. But the reality is, most of the top VPN channels are either owned outright, financially backed, or quietly sponsored by the very VPNs theyâ€™re reviewing. Thatâ€™s the core problemâ€”one we refuse to be part of.

Over time, it became clear that without any funding, we couldnâ€™t keep the project going. So we made a shiftâ€”but on our terms. We now allow affiliate links only for VPNs that meet strict standards: no ownership or investments in review platforms, no control over our content, and no shady backroom deals.

Let it be clearâ€”we will never promote or partner with any VPN that owns, invests in, or controls a review outlet. Period.

Our original no-affiliate stance helped us build trust, especially on Reddit, but even there, mods censored discussions and limited reach on honest discussions. In the end, ethical funding wasnâ€™t just a pivotâ€”it was a way to survive without ever compromising the mission.
