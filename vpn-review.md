All reviews are documented and open to public scrutiny. Methodological integrity is our top priority.

Got it. Here's a rewritten version in **Markdown** that makes it clear **you never accept affiliate linksâ€”now or in the future**:

## Review Ethics Policy

We maintain **strict ethical standards** for all VPN reviews. We do **not accept affiliate links**, sponsorships, or any form of compensation from VPN providersâ€”ever.

Our review criteria are based on the following **non-negotiable principles**:

1. **No Ownership or Investment in Review Sites**  
   The VPN provider must **not own**, fund, or hold any stake in any VPN review website or media outlet.

2. **No Influence on Reviews**  
   The VPN provider must **not pressure**, manipulate, or influence how we review, rank, or present their service.

We believe that true privacy advocacy and unbiased reviews cannot coexist with financial ties to the products being reviewed. Most of the top VPN review channels are owned, sponsored, or quietly influenced by the very companies they cover. Thatâ€™s a conflict of interest we reject outright.

PacketGhost was created to be different. From day one, we chose not to monetize through affiliate links so that our reviews would remain 100% independent, honest, and data-driven. That decision wasnâ€™t just a stanceâ€”itâ€™s the foundation of what we do.

We fund this project ourselves, with no external money, so we can speak freely and criticallyâ€”without fear of losing income, access, or favor.

**Let it be clear:**  
We will **never** accept affiliate commissions.  
We will **never** take money from the companies we review.  
We will **never** compromise our integrity for profit.

Our mission is transparency. Our loyalty is to the user. And that will never be for sale.

Let me know if you'd like to add a line about how readers can support the project (e.g. via donations, GitHub Sponsors, etc.) without compromising ethics.
