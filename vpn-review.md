# PacketGhost VPN Review Methodology

**PacketGhost** is an independent, open-source project dedicated to providing unbiased VPN reviews. Our evaluations are based on transparent criteria and real-world testing to help users make informed decisions.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Privacy** â€“ Logging policies, jurisdiction, and provider reputation

## Review Methodology

Each VPN is tested under consistent conditions to ensure fair comparisons. Our methodology includes:

- **Speed Tests** â€“ Conducted using standardized tools across multiple servers and regions
- **Privacy Audits** â€“ Examining logging policies, encryption standards, third-party audits, and business reputation
- **Feature Analysis** â€“ Checking features like kill switch, split tunneling, multihop, and platform support

All reviews are documented and open to public scrutiny. Methodological integrity is our top priority.

## Affiliate Program Policy

We maintain **strict ethical standards** for affiliate relationships. Affiliate links are only used for VPNs that meet the following **non-negotiable criteria**:

1. **No Ownership or Investment in Review Sites**  
   The VPN provider must **not own**, fund, or hold any stake in any VPN review website or media outlet that evaluates VPNs.

2. **No Influence on Reviews**  
   The VPN provider must **not pressure**, manipulate, or restrict how we review or rank them.

Any partnership must align with our values of **independence and transparency**. If a VPN fails to meet these standards, we will not engage in an affiliate relationshipâ€”regardless of compensation.

Originally, we launched PacketGhost with zero affiliate links to prove a pointâ€”that VPN reviews can be ethical, transparent, and data-driven without being driven by profit. But over time, we realized that without any financial support, it became harder to justify the time and effort needed to keep the project alive. That said, we knew we could still do it the right way: by only partnering with VPNs that meet strict standardsâ€”no ownership of review sites, no influence on rankings, no shady backdoor deals. The initial no-affiliate approach also helped us gain traction on Reddit, but even then, overly controlling mods shut down discussion and visibility, making it clear that ethical funding was the only sustainable path forward.
